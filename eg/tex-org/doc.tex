\TeX{} is a typesetting computer program created by \emph{Donald Knuth},
originally for his magnum opus, \textsf{The Art of Computer
  Programming}.It takes a "plain" text file and converts it into a
high-quality document for printing or on-screen viewing.

\LaTeX{} is a macro system built on top of \TeX{} that aims to simplify its
use and automate many common formatting tasks. It is the de-facto
standard for academic journals and books, and provides some of the best
typography free software has to offer.

\emph{Leslie B. Lamport} (born February 7, 1941) is an American computer
scientist. Lamport is best known for his seminal work in distributed
systems and as the initial developer of the document preparation system
\LaTeX. He was the winner of the 2013 Turing Award for imposing clear,
well-defined coherence on the seemingly chaotic behavior of distributed
computing systems, in which several autonomous computers communicate
with each other by passing messages. He devised important algorithms and
developed formal modeling and verification protocols that improve the
quality of real distributed systems. These contributions have resulted
in improved correctness, performance, and reliability of computer
systems.
