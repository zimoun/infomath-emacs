  abstract  = {Since the first edition of this book was published in 1996, tremendous progress has been made in the scientific and
                  engineering disciplines regarding the use of iterative methods for linear systems. The size and complexity of the new
                  generation of linear and nonlinear systems arising in typical applications has grown. Solving the three-dimensional models
                  of these problems using direct solvers is no longer effective. At the same time, parallel computing has penetrated these
                  application areas as it became less expensive and standardized. Iterative methods are easier than direct solvers to
                  implement on parallel computers but require approaches and solution algorithms that are different from classical
                  methods. Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems, Second Edition gives an in-depth, up-to-date view of practical
                  algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems of equations. These equations can number in the millions and are sparse
                  in the sense that each involves only a small number of unknowns. The methods described are iterative, i.e., they provide
                  sequences of approximations that will converge to the solution. This new edition includes a wide range of the best methods
                  available today. The author has added a new chapter on multigrid techniques and has updated material throughout the text,
                  particularly the chapters on sparse matrices, Krylov subspace methods, preconditioning techniques, and parallel
                  preconditioners. Material on older topics has been removed or shortened, numerous exercises have been added, and many
                  typographical errors have been corrected. The updated and expanded bibliography now includes more recent works emphasizing
                  new and important research topics in this field. Audience This book can be used to teach graduate-level courses on
                  iterative methods for linear systems. Engineers and mathematicians will find its contents easily accessible, and
                  practitioners and educators will value it as a helpful resource. The preface includes syllabi that can be used for either
                  a semester- or quarter-length course in both mathematics and computer science. Contents Preface to the Second Edition;
